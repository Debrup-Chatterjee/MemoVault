# 🧠 MemoVault – On-Chain Secure Text Saver

### 💎 Project Description
**MemoVault** is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that allows users to **securely store, update, and delete text entries directly on the blockchain**.  
Each text (called a *memo*) is permanently recorded on-chain, giving users full ownership and transparency over their data.  

This project is perfect for learning **Solidity fundamentals**, **smart contract storage patterns**, and **access control** — while building something practical!

### 🚀 What It Does
MemoVault enables anyone with a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) to:
- Create memos and store them **permanently on-chain**  
- View their memos anytime using their wallet address  
- Update or delete their own memos (nobody else can!)  
- Access memo details such as owner, text, and timestamp  

All actions are recorded via **events** on the blockchain, ensuring full traceability.

### ✨ Features
- 🧱 **Create**: Save text securely on the blockchain  
- 🔍 **Read**: Retrieve stored memos by ID  
- ✏️ **Update**: Modify your own memos anytime  
- 🗑️ **Delete**: Permanently remove your memos  
- ⏱️ **Timestamps**: Each action is time-stamped for tracking  
- 🔒 **Ownership Control**: Only the creator of a memo can modify or delete it  
- 📜 **Event Logs**: Every action (create/update/delete) emits an event visible on Block Explorer
